# Processing: An Open-Source Platform for Education and Artistic Expression

![Event Cover](FacebookCoverMona.jpg)

Our April 16th FOSUG meeting will be presented by educator and digital artist Jacob Joaquin. Jacob will give a demonstration of Processing, "a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts." Processing was originally conceived as a tool for teaching the fundamentals of computation but has also transformed into a visual medium for artistic expression, becoming the premiere platform for many works both big and small. Processing is actively being used for education worldwide in high schools, colleges, and MOOCs, including NYU, UCLA, and KhanAcademy.org. There are versions of Processing for Java and Javascript, and plays well with physical computing devices such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
